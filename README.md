# Etch-a-Sketch

A Etch-a-Sketch webpage with tiles which change color when the cursor hovers above them. The user can input the number of tiles they want on the sides.

First, we create a default 16x16 grid in the DOM through Javascript.
    Create a big div container.
    Make that div a grid container (in the CSS).
    Create as many children divs as required (16 at first).
